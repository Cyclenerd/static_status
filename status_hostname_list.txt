# What should be monitored? Each line one entry.
#
# Structure:
# <COMMAND>;<HOSTNAME, IP or URL,PATH>;<PORT, GREP TEXT or HTTP STATUS>
#
# COMMAND: Command to run. Can be ping, curl or nc.
#          ping        = send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts
#          curl        = transfer a URL
#          http-status = check the HTTP status of a URL
#          nc          = check TCP and UDP connections
#          grep        = extension to the curl check
#                        curl downloads the webpage and pipes it to grep,
#                        that checks if the keyword is in the page.
#          traceroute  = check if host or ip exists in route path to MY_TRACEROUTE_HOST
#          script      = execute a script which returns 0 on success
#
# HOSTNAME: Hostname for the 'ping', 'nc' or 'traceroute' command
# IP: IP adress for the 'ping', 'nc' or 'traceroute' command
# URL: URL called by the command 'curl', 'http-status' and 'grep'. I.e. https://www.heise.de/ping or ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/README
# PATH: PATH of the script called by the command 'script', eg. check.sh
# The pipe `|` can be used as a separator to display a custom text instead of the HOSTNAME/IP/URL (see example below).
#
# PORT: Optional port specification. Only for 'nc' command.
# GREP TEXT: Text to look for when using the 'grep' command.
# HTTP STATUS: HTTP status code required to pass when using the 'http-status' command.

#
# Note:
# This HOSTNAME or IP is not the host to which the route path is traced. This is done via the parameter MY_TRACEROUTE_HOST
# This HOSTNAME or IP must be present in the route path.
# MAX NUMBER OF HOPS sets the max time-to-live (max number of hops) used in outgoing probe packets.
# If the hostname should always be the third hop, enter 3.
